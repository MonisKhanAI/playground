It felt great on my back warmed up real nice with my husbands hands and it made the massage great!I couldn't smell the almond fragrance, I was hoping it would smell like almond jello, mm that stuff Is yummy. a little disappointed about that but wasn't too bothered.Don't think I'm a strong believer of aromatherapy.Would recommend the oil it feels great on my skin!

I purchased the Flat-top comb with level to ensure my giving him a great flat top haircut. It was so easy to use and the haircut was ""A-1"" in my book. Well worth the price and the saving of time from the free style cutting, I used to use. Thanks. John",health personal care,beauty

5,"Ultima Replenisher, Red Raspberry, 90-Serving Canister Personnaly speaking Raspberry is not very good, but I can't complain. When you mix this drink it is better if you can give 15 minuetes or so to mix up. If you can't you get a minor chaulky taste. I do however like it very much.

6,"PediaSure Nutrition Drink, Strawberry, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24) My child is pretty picky and has tonsillitis so any little infection , he won't eat anythingPediasure comes so handy during these times. This tastes great and my child asks for it too. It says to serve it very cold but he prefers it at room temp or even warm , so I do warm it in the microwave for 20 to 30 secsThe costs of this can add up though and it's best to buy them in bulk, samsclub only carries vanilla and I like to mix some flavors up. Thanks to amazon you get the flavor variety in bulk and with Subscribe and save it's the same price as in SAMs club ( but with additional flavors)I would give this a 5 star review but for the prescence of BPA in the cap which they say doesn't come in contact with the milk (?).",health personal care,grocery gourmet food
7,"Stila Smudge Pot, 0.14 Ounce I'm giving this 3 stars because while I didn't have success with it, I think other people will.I used an eyeliner brush to apply this, which worked fairly well. I got a nice line, although it was quite smudgy (as the name implies). This is nice if you're trying for that look, but less so if you want to line our upper eyelid. Still, it was okay.But, it was gone in about an hour. I must have oily eyelids, because this happens with nearly all liners. I'm still searching for one that will stay on. This seems to be a problem with me, not the product. I have had more success with liquid than this type.Overall, I would say that it was just okay. I've used other brands that seem to do a better job.",beauty,health personal care

10,"Jason Earth's Best Baby Care Lavender Tear-Free 2-in-1 Shampoo & Body Wash, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3) I bought this because hubby wanted 'real' baby shampoo/wash and I wanted something organic and natural as possible. I like the flip-top. It pops up at the touch of a button. I don't like the long list of ingredients - it still has some chemicals thrown in, like sodium benzoate. It does clean baby, and his hair smells nice. I have since learned that organic liquid castille soap (like Dr. Bronner's baby castille soap) is fine for hair and body. I put some in a liquid soap 'foaming' bottle with some jojoba oil for conditioning & I use that for shampoo. You can google recipes for homemade shampoo using castille soap. You can also use melted coconut butter or flax oil to condition your hair (sounds silly, but it works great!) Be sure to use only a little bit of coconut butter before washing your hair (yes, condition before washing, not after) and use only a small amount - it goes a long way.",baby products,beauty
11,"Caldrea Countertop Cleaner 16 oz A couple years ago I ran across an advertisement for a natural/green all-purposey cleaner (not Caldrea). The gist of the ad was that this brand's ""fun new scents"" made cleaning fun. At the time, I laughed - derisively - because they didn't smell all that terrific, and certainly not amazing enough to turn cleaning the kitchen into something fun.Now, I still wouldn't call cleaning the kitchen or bathroom ""fun,"" but Caldrea actually comes close.Most importantly, I'm impressed with how well it cleans. That's a hazard of using green cleaners; they take out all the harsh chemicals to make them safer for you and your families and your environment, but it was those harsh chemicals that actually cleaned. (Toilet bowl cleaner is a good example. I refuse to get a gentle, natural toilet bowl cleaner. The brand I use is like 400% hydrochloric acid. It actually smokes when you squirt it in the bowl. Forget natural; that stuff rocks.) Caldrea, at least the countertop cleaner, works as well as a traditional all purpose cleaner. It's a higher-surfactant formula than I'm used to seeing, which means that it gets sudsy and cuts through grease, and you seem to need less of it than you do regular cleaners. Which is good, 'cause it ain't cheap. Don't let the ""countertop cleaner"" name fool you, either. It's very all-purpose. (In fact, I have no proof, but I suspect it's really their all-purpose cleaner diluted. So for that matter, you might just want to get that and dilute it yourself in an empty spray bottle to stretch your dollars.)The other thing I like is the fragrance. I have the Sea Salt Neroli one, and it's very nice. If you know what neroli smells like and you're buying it based on that, you might be disappointed; I bought this because I like neroli's scent so much and it kind of missed the mark. The fact that I'm giving this cleaner five stars, though, should point out that even though it's not quite true to neroli, it's still a very pleasant scent. It's exactly the right strength, too. It doesn't overpower your house for days like, oh, Pine Sol or something, but it doesn't immediately evaporate, either. It's a very pleasant, clean smell - not chemical or cloying - that is just strong enough for you to catch a hint of it an hour or two later when you walk through the kitchen.My point to telling you about the ""makes cleaning fun!"" ad is that this is the closest I've ever come to actually enjoying myself cleaning. Not that it's any less of a pain, but I find myself a little more motivated if it means that my kitchen gets to smell pretty afterward. I do suggest trying this. It's expensive, true, and usually efficacy is really the only thing I'm after in a cleaner, but this is efficacious with a fun little reward at the end",beauty,health personal care

16,"Sedona Suite Have you been to the edge of eternity? Well I have, and it is Sedona Suite.I love this album. From the soothing synthesizer to the feeling of resentment and muted joy comparable to what I get when I look at wedding notices in the local paper, this album delivers more than UPS on a substitute federal holiday that isn't observed by private industry. As we near the 20th anniversary of this album's release, I can comfortably say no other album has captured the beauty of Yavapai and Coconino counties as this wonderful track set--so, so completely.Wikipedia calls Tom Barabas ""This article may not meet the notability requirements for music,"" but I think Sedona Suite is the most notable piece of easy listening jam I've had since I put that orange marmalade in my ear last Christmas.My favorite track has to be Suite Memories. It reminds me of my ""suite"" memory--the time I went with my youth pastor to a 4H fair in Branson, MO where in a somewhat inappropriate way I learned how to bribe a desk clerk and reroute an IP address.Is this making sense?Look, life is a mystery, and so is beauty",health personal care,toys games
17,"GiGi Brazilian Wax Microwave Formula Hair Removal System Hair Removal Wax This is the first wax removal product I have used on my own. It was incredibly easy. I bought it because I have been thinking about doing my own wax removal on my legs and didn't want to purchase a warmer and wax, if I thought it was too difficult. There was very very little pain, I tweezed a few spots afterwards, and that was excruciating. The down side was the wax would get stiff quickly. It took a little bit to get the right consistancy so that it would spread easily - but hey its my first time. I did decide that this is an excellent choice for touch ups while traveling without having to take the warmer and wax. I will definitly stick with this line of products and will purchase another microwave kit set.",beauty,health personal care

I don't have to keep all the bottles on the floor of the shower.- clean. no bottles = no scum build-up around the bottom of the bottles.- basket adds more rooms to keep organized for things that does not go in the dispensers.- refilling is easy, just open the top cover and pour.Cons",beauty,baby products

21,"Dymatize Nutrition ISO 100 Whey Protein Powder By now I've tried both the chocolate and fuzzy navel flavors (my first review commented on vanilla only). Both chocolate and fuzzy navel taste outstanding! Highly recommended along with vanilla! I now keep all three available to supplement my daily meals (vanilla, chocolate, and fuzzy navel). I've been using the vanilla and chocolate much longer than fuzzy navel, but so far the fuzzy navel flavor is nearly addictive to my tastes (my craving for it may eventually pass, but so far I like it as well if not better than chocolate or vanilla). The fuzzy navel flavor tastes close to vanilla with a very light touch of peach and orange added. In a way the flavor reminds me of the ""lemon"" ice cream or frozen custard I ate as a kid; it really didn't taste like lemon at all, but was more interesting and tastier than vanilla. The fuzzy navel flavor is so subtle you could probably use it in frozen fruit smoothies instead of vanilla (I haven't tried this yet) and not notice much of a difference (and this would allow you to reduce your inventory from three flavors to two flavors by dropping the vanilla).I am on my 3rd 5 lb container of vanilla, 2nd chocolate and 1st fuzzy navel. I often pack a lean lunch (including a small amount of animal protein, fruit and vegetable) and premix four servings of ISO*100 to take with me when I go off to work for the day (following something similar to BFL, eating a meal every two hours or so) and all flavors keep well throughout the day when premixed (or even keep well overnight). I still prefer to mix on the fly when I am going to be around the house (see my previous vanilla review for how to chill your water with ice without blending any foam into your delicious meal replacement). When I start weight training again I will add two additional daily servings of ISO*100 (to bring daily protein intake up to one gram of protein per pound of body weight when including my two regular meals).It does not matter whether the IOS*100 you buy has a white or black plastic container, or whether what you buy is labeled as a ""gourmet"" flavor or not. Don't pay more; if you hunt online price you should be able to find 5 lb quantities for somewhere around $60 or less. As far as I can tell, Dymatize has replaced their old blends with new blends labeled ""Gourmet"" and part of that upgrade involves changing the container color from white to black. The last time I ordered online, the picture of what I ordered showed a white container and did not include the word Gourmet on the flavor label; what I received in the mail was the black container with the Gourmet labeling. My first two containers of vanilla were the old recipe in the white containers; and compared to the newer gourmet black container this older style vanilla was slightly ""grainy"" when thoroughly mixed compared to the newer ISO*100 products from Dymatize (my chocolate and fuzzy navel were ever grainy but these have always been in black containers).Regarding Dymatize's use of Sucralose; although you can find some limited negative press on this particular artificial sweetener, it is one of the most recently developed zero-carb sweeteners and considered by most authorities to be much healthier than earlier popular artificial sweeteners. If anything better comes along in terms of ""health"" and ""taste"" I'm sure Dymatize will be quick to pick it up. In the meantime, having a pure high protein low carb drink is a great convenience. I still have not found a better or comparable product. Thank You Dymatize and all the retailers selling this at affordable prices.",health personal care,grocery gourmet food

It has a lot of room and many pockets to allow you to set up what you need to carry in an organized way. I have no issue with zippering the cool side even when loaded with pens and vials and both ice packs.My one disappointment is that it is advertised with a detachable container for used sharps and supplies to hold them until you can move them to an appropriate permanent container, however the case came with 'snaps' where this container must attach but no container as it is showing the in the images and mentioned in what comes with the case. One of the several things I was looking for in a case was a special container like this so I did not have to devote a pocket to playing the role or carrying a separate container. I have looked and there does not seem to be anywhere this container is sold separately so I am bit bemused by why it was not included in the original packaging. The case came sealed in its packaging so I don't think it was originally there and just strayed.Update",health personal care,toys games

When I picked it up from the UPS guy the package was large but I could easily pick this up with one hand while carrying my son. I guess this should have tipped me off to how light it would be. It snapped together easy without tools which is a plus and has brakes for the back wheels but all the wheels are plastic and because the thing is so light it slides everywhere even on carpet. He likes playing with the front and the lights/music he enjoys a lot but wants to climb up the front too but due to it's lightness it would just tip over on him if I wasn't there to prevent the thing tipping over. He cannot even pull himself up from the back because again too light, tips. He might be able to use it when he is older (when he is better at walking but that's kind of the point of why I wanted it) but not sure. I would return it but don't know if I can take it apart again and he has used the front part which he enjoys but I cannot leave him alone with it or in the same room with him as he is moving fast now (crawling).

57,Bragg Organic Vinegar Apple Cider () After reading up on ACV for a few months I finally tried it. I have acne and I bought it for the sole purpose of getting my skin clear. For the past 3 months I have been using it and I can say it has been a miracle cure for my skin. I typically take it 3 times a day (1 tablespoon in about 2oz to 4oz of water) and it does the job. Literally in 2 days my skin showed signs of clearing. Just recently I took a 10 day trip to Japan and I left the bottle because I was unsure about being able to travel with it. My breakouts slowly came back and upon returning home I started taking it immediately and overnight my skin was back to normal. This is one product that I can say for sure has an effect on acne. It also makes me feel a little full if I drink it before a meal.,grocery gourmet food,beauty
58,"Skin Tight In-grown Hair Lotion Extra Strength 4 oz I am an African American female who suffers from hairs on my chin. For years, I plucked and shaved them, eventually developing serious ingrown hair bumps which are unsightly under make-up. I tried many products for ethnic skin to relieve the problem, even visiting a dermatologist for different prescriptions, but nothing worked. I researched online for possible remedies and came across the site for B&C Skin Tight. I read several positive reviews, then quickly visited my beauty supply store. I was fortunate to obtain a few sample packets. I tried it and had almost immediate improvement! Within a week, the bumps virtually disappeared! I now use the Razor & Bump Astringent in the morning and the Ingrown Hair & Razor Bump Creme at night. The website says not to be used with the astringent but I've had no problems. In fact, the creme moisturizes because the astringent can be somewhat drying to the skin. When I get a little lax and don't use the products for a few days, the bumps return. Skin Tight products are a bit pricey but less expensive than prescription products and give fantastic results!",health personal care,beauty

62,"Deb-El Just Whites, 3-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6) I rarely buy eggs and when I do I have to think of ways to use the leftovers before they spoil. So I bought a container of Just Whites to keep conveniently in the cabinet. I thought it would be great to have around anytime I wanted to make something and not have to go to the store to buy eggs or worry about having more than I needed, but I don't like using this product. The powder is ridiculously sticky, making it difficult to use. When mixing with water like the instructions say the powder simply sticks to the fork or whisk in clumps and won't combine with the liquid. It has replaced egg whites in some baked goods I've used it for but Just Whites has been more of an annoyance than a convenience.",grocery gourmet food,health personal care

As she grew older, she blew out both knees (2 TPLO surgeries), and developed arthritis in her hips, pelvis, both knees, left elbow and her ankles. We've tried most of the products out there over the years, and I never saw a difference in her walk.Finally, last year, the surgeon who did her most recent knee surgery suggested we try GlycoFlex III. After about 3 weeks, for the first time in her life, she was walking without a limp. I had to ask friends to watch her walk and tell me if she was limping because I couldn't believe it could be true.We started out with 2 tablets a day, but now she gets one in the evening and 1/2 in the morning. She doesn't particularly like to eat them, so I break them up into her dinner and breakfast.Amazon has the best price I've seen on GlycoFlex III, anywhere.",pet supplies,health personal care

69,"Little Tikes 2-in-1 Snug & Secure Swing I purchased this swing for my 9 month old son. He loves to swing. However the swing straps on this swing seemed to annoy him. Due to the design of the straps he was able to free himself, and just hang over the safety bar. The design also seemed to push him down and caused him to slouch and lean in unconfortable ways, so he never wanted to stay in this swing very long. The rope was also very short, as the instructions indicate swing should be no more than 18"" off the groud, and ours was easily 3'. Rope was also hard to adjust to swing straight, so he was always swinging a bit crooked.

74,"Gund Baby Spunky Plush Puppy Toy Small, Blue When my twin boy and girl were born they were given tons of plush toys. Over the course of a few month they had settled on this blue and pink dog as the only toy they can fall asleep with. The ears and tail are perfect biting and sucking size, and the material seems to be what sets this apart from other toys. If they lost their puppy at night they would cry until it was returned to them. Today, at one, they still require it to fall asleep. The barking device seems unnecessary. I have laundered these toys many many times and the barking device still works. I hope it doesn't leak chemicals from the battery. The fabric is permanently browned from saliva and chewing :) We used to have three puppies to rotate for laundry. We lost on the other day and need to order a few more.

After reading about the negative effects of other mostly chemical soup type deodorants, I began searching out all natural alternatives. I have tried about 10 different kinds and this is by far my favorite. But I should mention, every one is different and that is probably why some of the other highly rated deodorants I tried didn't really work well for me, some of them even made me break out, not because they are bad, but because everybody is different. And thats also why you are reading bad reviews for this product. For me, nothing comes close to this deodorant. It LASTS forever! I only need to buy a new stick every couple of months. It lasts a long time too (hours). Moreover, it actually works! Some of those all natural sticks didn't do much of anything. It used to be 100% all natural, but they changed it for some reason and now it is all natural EXCEPT for they add fragrance to it. However, I would rather have one unnatural ingredient added to an otherwise natural product than buy a regular 100% chemical product from a big grocery chain.",beauty,health personal care

We have a swing set already set up, and the length was just right for us.- The safety straps do take some getting used to in order to release them, but are very secure, so if your toddler happens to be a mini-Houdini, you can rest assured they probably still won't be able to get out of this!- The way the shoulder straps 'fit' does cause them to slouch quite a bit, but my son is a professional lounger (you should see him in his stroller - with his feet up!) and doesn't seem bothered by this.- A few reviews said the straps mildew easily - I live in what's been called the 'second sunniest town in the U.S.' so not a problem for me.- Some reviewers said it flipped easily. I've tried to flip it and can't. In the event that it did somehow tip over, it seems like the shoulder straps would keep your child in place, and a good parent would be standing right there anyway.I would recommend this swing, but you know your child (and your environment) best - consider these things and go with your gut!",toys games,baby products
121,"nan I ordered this bedcane for my husband who is 6' tall, weighs about 250 lbs, and has mobility issues with weakness in his legs. It came partially assembled with very clear directions. I was able to install it myself in less than 10 minutes. It is a sturdy design and works wonderfully for him. The adjusbability of the metal handle was nice to set it at the perfect height for his needs. The removable pocket that slips over the handle is great for him to have items that he uses during the night at arm's reach. The strap that comes with it lays under the mattress and attaches to the bed frame on the other side of the bed. Because our box springs fits very tight along the bed frame I attached the strap to the leg of the bed frame instead of the side and the strap was plenty long enough to accomodate that change. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.",health personal care,baby products

Excuse me, I learned about pregnancy as a young child of three, but I knew nothing of sex until I was much older. When my little sister looks at my pregnant mother, the last thing she ever thinks about is sex. Kids know nothing about sex when they handle this doll, and if they do, it's because you told them! Midge doesn't doesn't say anything about sex (yeah, having a baby, but not full-blown SEX). Of course, if you're so dirty in the mind, that you HAVE to think ""sex"" every time you see a pregnant woman (or doll, for that matter), please, get mental therapy, because we don't need kids as young as four ( who know nothing of sex, just pregnancy) to read your reviews, and ask ""Mommy, what is sex?""Speaking of sex, parents, if you don't let your kids have a single idea of what sex is, they won't listen to you later on in life when you try to tell them about sex.

136,"Kinerase Lip Treatment I had seen slight plumping after using City Lips for a few months when I started using Kinerase. It took a few more months with the Kinerase, but I started seeing even greater gains in lip volume. My lower lip, which was never extemely thin, showed improvements first, but now, after more than a year, even my flimsy top lip has plumped up. It may have taken less time had I followed instructions better - it's important to apply outside the lip line and even going into the mouth slightly.The bottom line is that, while you may not see immediate results, you will eventually be shocked at what nice lips you have. Heck, I even got a comment a few days ago about what pretty lips I have (when I wasn't even wearing lipstick or gloss)...that's a first for me!!",health personal care,beauty

172,"Adam And Eve Adams Pleasureskin Dildo 7.75 Inch Natural First, let me preface this review by stating that at this price, just buy the toy...it's worth it. Even if you don't love it (which, based on our experience it not likely) you're only out a negligible amount of money.Now on to the review...I bought this for my wife recently after trying a few dildos with her in the past. She is very picky when it comes to toys and has complained about texture/rigidity and size. I read and watched countless reviews on this toy on Amazon and other sites and nearly all said it was HUGE but very lifelike and most were very favorable. I went ahead and ordered it when I found it on Amazon for this price.We agree on both descriptions of size and feel. While the toy is big, very BIG, it's incredibly lifelike and the head is very soft for comfortable penetration. This has been a complaint by my wife in the past - others we've tried have huge heads (unrealistically so) and/or have been so hard that they weren't pleasurable to use at all. The size is part of the fun part...it takes a good amount of lube and going slowly at first, but she'll be used to it in mere seconds. The shaft is somewhat soft/pliable on the outside, but firm at the core, just like the real thing. The outer layer moves slightly as well, creating a more realistic effect. We have yet to use the suction cup with her for long, so I will withhold comment on this, though it seems you have to adjust it to get it just right to stay put.When my wife first saw this thing after taking it out of the package, she thought there was no way she would enjoy it. However, after the first use, which was more fun than we imagined, she told me she was embarrassed at how much she likes this thing. Guys, that right there should tell you to buy it now for your significant others. Yes, it's bigger than you. No, it won't matter to her...or you for that matter when you see how much fun she has with it!",health personal care,toys games

His hair has never been easier to brush and it stays looking brushed for much longer now. Because the head of the brush is so large, it doesn't take nearly as long to brush his whole body and the hair it picks up comes out of the tines very easily.However, I was hoping for a brush that my dog didn't hate. I bought this brush because some reviews said it was good for sensitive skin and wouldn't hurt. I disagree whole-heartedly. Poor pup looks so sad when I pull the brush out and he really acts like it hurts when I brush more sensitive areas like his legs. I pulled the brush across my own skin and it left scratches when I didn't even brush hard.I will continue to use this brush because it does work really well.

He goes right to sleep with both old and new happy as a clam. He knows that one stays here and has a special place in his drawers. He can get it any time but it stays here. I think that when there is a special blanket a child is attached to it is a good idea to get two or three because you never know when the child will be sick or might lose it temporarily and then rotate them out frequently like you do the sheets on the bed.

Although there is a lot of thread on the reel, the retracting elastic gets too tight and breaks when about 6 feet of thread is extended.Additionally, the thread on my reel had taken on the curve of the reel, instead of lying flat. I expect that the thread is twisted as it is placed on the device, causing this flaw. This caused it to have a curvy wave like very curly hair. The result was that the I.T. was more obviously reflecting every light source than if it was strait. I tried to use the I.T. on another reel, but it kept coming off, due to the curliness.The I.T. on this reel is stronger than others I have tried.If you are looking for a powered reel, I have had very good results with the Tarantula, which doesn't have any of the problems of this reel.",toys games,health personal care

223,"Fluffy Cat Puppet Received and returned Ms. Fat Cat. Her fur was too rough, and ours seemed to have been sewn a little defectively, with fur too close to one eye, covering it persistently, despite my attempts to manipulate that. Also the fur near top of her head sewn in a very triangular shape, rather than rounded. Her legs splayed a bit far with puppet on (or off) and attempts to hold feet in place. Also her feet/paws stuffed to a hardness that when moved around was more like a deceased cat (I don't even want to say dead cat, but that's what it made me think of). Also, her face and cheeks are similarly hard and stuffed, with a very hard and very small mouth, too tough to manipulate. (This is unlike many of the other Folkmanis puppets.) She has a little tongue that is like a piece of fabric or paper stuck in the mouth, supposed to make it cute or interesting, but it wasn't. (Cannot manipulate the tongue.) I had thought her fat cat body would be cute or cuddly in some manner, but she was entirely (and sadly for us) unappealing to my two little children as well.

229,"Spectrum Naturals - Coconut Oil Unrefined, 14 oz liquid There is few dollar of difference between refined and unrefined. I only cook with extra virgin olive oil since the mono to poly unsaturated oil is 7 compare to almond 4.1 and coconut 3.2. Applying heat to poly-unsaturated fat creates unhealthy factors compared to mono-unsaturated fats. Now, once in a while it is fine for me if the oil is becoming rancid to use as cooking oil and consume before the 6 months window before the nut oil going rancid but on regular basis it is not a good idea. There is two type of nut oil, and unlike one reviewer who puts PHD next to her name and misinforms, refined is an oil that is missing some characteristics of the nut like smell and taste and for that reason you can apply more heat to refined since it is missing certain ingredients which can burn during cooking and create unpleasant conditions. Not having smell has nothing to do with organic or conventional seed. Coconut is the healthiest of all but it is like a cream not a lotion so I use coconut oil for hands and feet. Any nut oil should be good enough that you can consume it raw or use it in cooking and Spectrum is the better one since it really is sold all over right next to all other cooking oils instead of health section.

235,"Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge I bought this pillow, because I have always been and always will be a back sleeper. Regardless of how many times I went to sleep on my side, I always woke up flat on my back, and now that I'm well into the third trimester, I knew it was time to do something about that. My problem is that when I lie on my side, I get horrible cramps in my thighs and hips and end up on my back to get the pressure off of them. I searched for pillows in a number of places, but this was the only one that claimed it supported the lower back (others advertised belly support, which isn't a huge deal to me), so I gave it a try. When I first opened the box, I wasn't too sure about it--it looked very flimsy and small. But after setting it up, it supported me completely! And I even woke up not on my side once, but the wonderful thing about the design of this pillow is that even when I get all the pressure off my hips and thighs, it keeps me at an angle, so I'm never actually flat on my back. But the majority of the time, the back support side supplied enough firm support that I was comfortable on my side without putting pressure on my thighs and hips. I love this pillow and wish I had bought it 27 weeks ago, when I first found out I was pregnant. But instead, I bought a full body pillow, which although was comfy to sleep on, provided no support but in front and was large and cumbersome. This wedge pillow is supportive, but takes up just enough space. It's wonderful and a huge comfort for back sleepers.",baby products,health personal care
236,"Drinkwell Hydro-Go Pet Canteen I ordered one of these last year and it worked well until the stopper strap broke and then lost the stopper, so I got a stopper at the hardware store and kept on using it. I liked the design enough, and after losing the replacement stopper, that I decided to try replacing it.I ordered another one a couple of weeks ago and, when it arrived, the plastic strap holding the stopper cap was already broken. So I sent it back for a replacement, which was prompt in arriving. This one was not only was broken when it arrived but the stopper cap was missing completely - which is why I had ordered another one in the first place.At this point, I decided to stick with the original unit and keep a small stock of cork or rubber stoppers handy.The notable flaws in the design are; the plastic used for the cap/stopper assembly is inappropriate (will not handle the requisite flexing to operate the stopper) and the plastic strap for the stopper sticks out from the flat side of the canteen so one has to carry it with the bowl against the body, so one has the choice of getting wet from the bowl or having the plastic strap edge poking you. After the stopper broke off I trimmed back the leftover plastic on the cap to allow me to carry it with the canteen against my body which is much more comfortable.It's a nice idea, but the design is flawed and the quality control is poor, Amazon should at least look a the products it sells prior to delivery to ensure it is in operational form/has all the parts.",pet supplies,health personal care

They do not even fit in, they'd 100% fall off with your hamster's or fish's nose breeze.To sum it up, this was the worst $20 spent in my entire online purchase.

I like the sturdiness of the wood and wire. Rabbits chew plastic so the wire makes this ideal for ferrets, rabbits or guinea pigs.",baby products,pet supplies

244,"Wahl Comb & Cut Hair Clippers Hairstyle Grooming Kit For someone like me, who becomes ever more ""follicularly-challenged"" with each passing year, this combNcut works like a charm. I've enviously read reviews where this product barely makes a dent on a thick head of hair. That may be so, but for my thinning, slowly-growing one, a few passes per section leaves it looking reasonably fresh and shaped in between cuts. Will this replace a good haircut? Definitely not but it will extend the intervals between cuts by nicely thinning and shaping the sides and back, which in my case, grow a lot faster than do the top and front. Most importantly a little bit of attention each week keeps you well groomed, but an incidental benefit is that by extending my hair cut cycle from approximately 4 to 6 weeks @ $22 (cut and tip) per cut, I'm saving about $90/yr while actually looking better between cuts.This trimmer is pretty fool-proof and the instructions are easy to follow. Essentially take 3 passes per section on the thick part of your head and 1 pass on your thinning hair. Repeat as necessary and you're good to go.",health personal care,beauty

253,"CarbRite Bar, 12 bars Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in. The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",health personal care,grocery gourmet food

258,"Tranquility TopLiner Mini Booster Pad Diaper Inserts Pk/25 First a tip to those who are having leaks with babies younger than a year old, because really you shouldn't be leaking yet at that age -- always use a special nighttime diaper and go up a diaper size for your night diapers when you start getting leaks, even if your baby is still using the smaller size day diaper. That always did the trick for us. That is, up until about 19 months old when we got up to size 5 and then 6 in nighttime diapers (Huggies) and they just weren't big around at the waist in front to contain the urine for a boy who sleeps on his stomach a lot. I tried using a maxi pad across the top inside the diaper and that helped a little but I still got leaks. I determined we needed simply extra absorbency inside the diaper so I got these Tranquility mini booster pad liners. I was desperate because we were having bad leaks every single night. Oh my gosh, what a relief. They worked from the first night onward. No leaks 4 nights in a row so far. For my boy, I don't put these across the top horizontally, I put them vertically inside the diaper but place them further up in front for a stomach-sleeping boy. The edge of the liner should be at the edge of the top front waist part, or just below that. Other tips",health personal care,baby products

I guess it might not work as a centerpiece, but 3/4 of it is very pretty to look at, and it came with two good size bags of rocks, plenty if you leave the ugly side alone.Also, even if you overfill this fountain there's almost no splashing and no leaking out of the bottom either. I have it running all day long at work (up to 10 to 12 hours at a time), and it's very consistent, I only have to add filtered water occasionally.

It's amazing how cold that room-temperature air feels coming out of that mat! It felt like I was sitting on a huge refrigerated gel pak or something.If that wasn't uncomfortable enough, the bath became less of a spa and more of a frightening cauldron! I've got one of those extra large triangle-shaped soaking tubs, so it looks just like the spa tubs except without the bubbles. However, all the other spa baths I've seen and used do not splash the water so far out of the tub that it hits the walls - this Conair mat did! I was afraid at first I had it on the &quot;high&quot; setting, but it was &quot;low&quot; that caused such a stir. The higher setting was, of course, no better. Not that I want to admit this, but I am not a small woman, so I would think that someone normally sized would get thrown around even more and shudder to think of it.I think I might have been able to get past the cold, but I can't relax while fearing that the water will splash out of the tub and onto the floor, cabinets, walls, etc, so the longest I could use the mat was for less than five minutes a couple of times.

The instructions say to use a 16.9 oz bottle of water, which works very well for the fruit punch. For the lemonade, I found it a little strong and use a 20 oz bottle with 18 - 19 oz of water in it. I used to drink 2 - 4 sodas a day, a mix of regular and diet. With this stuff, I feel better and I am saving a bunch of calories from both the soda and from not feeling as hungry because I am drinking more water (albeit flavored water). I have several friends deployed over to the sandbox and, while Army water is purified, it suffers in taste. These are a huge hit over there. They seem to be as favored, or more so, as Crystal Light. Best of all, they cost less.",grocery gourmet food,health personal care

I panicked, as I was in the middle of a cycle and did not wish to run out. I re-ordered immediately and then the next day contacted Nutricity about the problem. After more than a 24 hour wait I got an e-mail back saying I was mistaken, that I had NEVER ordered from them! Could I send the confirmation e-mail of the order. Well of course I didn't any longer have the confirmation e-mail (it takes me almost 3 months to use a jar) but I sent them the invoice from my Amazon file.

So I decided we needed a solution. I went to the store and bought this amazing product afer reading the reviews here online. Well of course you have to stand by it while it works. You have to do that if it is running under hot water or on the stove anyway!!! It is great! You fill it to the appropriate water level, put the bottle in, and press the button. When it is done it shuts off. You take it out, shake it up, test it, and you are ready to go in less than 3 minutes. I also noticed that some of these reviews that gave bad ratings are from 2002?

316,"Malem Ultimate Selectable Bedwetting Alarm with Vibration - Royal Blue My 8 year old son started wetting the bed consistently at maybe 3 or 4 years old. He was a pretty dry kid at night before that. Nothing big changed in our lives, my husband's brother wet the bed until a pretty old age, or ped. just chalked it up to that. Well, both him and my 5 year old (another story altogether I guess) were both used to wearing underwear at night and I didn't have the heart (or frankly the money) to put them into pull-ups at night. Nothing against parents that use them, it just seemed to make them feel really badly when my husband and I discussed using them. This alarm works great. If you have it clipped in the right spot it senses the wetness when there is just a drop or two. I should probably read the directions again. We've had this alarm for over a year and this is the first time we've committed to use it every night. My son wakes up almost every night with it. The thing is, it wakes him up and he takes care of it himself. He goes to the bathroom and changes his underwear. Then he comes to me to help clip it back on. Probably 95% of the time, it's only his underwear that are a little wet. His pajamas and bed are dry. It's nice only having to wash one set (5 year old's) of sheets a night! BUT I'm not sure if this is helping get to the root of the problem or not. He doesn't seem to be waking up on his own yet. Sometimes he holds it all night though. It's probably been 8-10 weeks since we started using it. I just hope we can get past this and then start working with my other son (he'll be 6 in Dec. Also, just to make sure it detects the wetness right away, I clip it inside the ""flap"" area. Not sure what to call that but it seems to help that there's not an extra layer of fabric in the way. He's only wet really bad a few times, and out of those few times it's usually been when I was gone and he clipped it on himself. My husband thought he knew how to do it.Hope this helps....I do think the product itself does what it says. We've had no problems with the function of it.",health personal care,baby products

She used it daily and all the symptoms and disconfort disappeared within the 4 weeks before the appointment. She cancelled the appointment and the symptoms never returned. Like a miracle. Later, the car door left a big bruise and cut near Mom's knee. Again the jel healed the area without having to go the doctor.My neighbor had fallen and cut her leg in the shower in 2008, after a week of antibotics and in the hospital she came home supposely healed. After a few days, redness appeared, applied the jel & keeping a close watch, the redness was gone the next day, otherwise it would have been back to the doctor's office/ER.More recently, my spouse has always complained about the acne on the back. Decided why not apply the jel nightly.

I pumiced them in the shower about every other day but by pedicure time (once a month), it was embarrassing. And, due to the thickness, my heels would often crack - which was so painful.And then, to kick me while I am down, on a dark day, a few years ago in Chicago, they banned razors. I went spa to spa, begging, even hauling my own razor to no avail. I finally found a spa on the far side of the city (like 45 minutes away) that kept a hidden razor. And, in a warped way, I considered myself lucky!And then I happened across this wonder tool. When I first saw the price - I think that I laughed out loud. Who would pay $40 for a foot file? And then I started reading the reviews - super skeptical. Thinking - their feet could not have looked like mine. And then I decided to take the plunge - I plunked down $40 for a foot file.People, get on board. In one 15 minute session, my feet were pink and sooo soft.

The keep dry cover is good for preventing skin chafing and doesn't hurt or stick to sensitive nipples and keeps the moisture away from breasts which is perfect if dealing with thrush or cracked nipples.If you are going to use cloth, I like the Medela ones... but for disposables, these are by FAR the best.",health personal care,baby products

370,"Pure Instinct I found that when I started to wear this product, guys around me started to look more, some guys in my college classes were talking to me more, wanting to talk to me. At work everyone seemed more friendly when i wore it, especially those working near me. I found that some men react more to it than others. one of my friends, when he goes to give me a hug and he smells it he backs away saying, ""You're wearing that stuff again!"" because it affects him extremely. While with my boyfriend, there isn't much affect other than he loves the scent. If it's goal is to get guys to be more sexual, or passionate, I can't see it making a difference in him. :POverall, GREAT product. It's a small bottle but it last for a long time! I got it almost a month ago and haven't even used a quarter of it yet.",health personal care,beauty
371,Badger Air-Brush Co 200-1 Siphon Feed 200NH Airbrush I had originally purchased a very cheap air brush from Harbor Freight and you had to pull back on the button as you pushed down to get the paint to come out. I guess I am not the most coordinated person because I found it to be like patting my head and rubbing my stomach. I purchased this air brush and it works great. I use the air brush so shoot duracoat which is a polymer type paint used on firearms. It gives a very even coat and the flow control is easy to adjust.,toys games,health personal care

I have been patient to get this in the mail and it only took 3 days to get delivered. I was so exited and as i opened the bottle and dabbed a small amount on my wrist I became so in love with it. It smells like fruity and sweet but yet soft... its just an irresistible smell. I will definitely buy this product over and over again. I am so exited to start wearing this due to my husband coming back home from a 6 month deployment next week. :),health personal care,beauty

380,"7-Eleven Slurpie Maker As a long-time Slurpee addict who often travels to faraway lands where there are no 7-11 stores, I had to buy one of these just to see if I could make another bad habit go global. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product that came out of the machine; the taste and consistancy were much closer to a real Slurpee than I had expected when using Coke as the base solution. As some have noted, the operation of the unit does depend on there being plenty of sugar in whatever you're using as the liquid to freeze.Unfortunately, the product as a whole is impractical. Setup beforehand and subsequent dissasembly/cleaning are very time consuming, and difficult enough that I feel the suggested age of 6+ is really understating things. The way the gear assemblies need to be aligned during setup is far too tricky for a typical child to handle, and I wouldn't be surprised to find some adults struggling with it. You only get 12oz of Slurpee per batch, and you'll be lucky to get three batches done before the entire center ice assembly has warmed too much to be useful and needs to be refilled to make more.In the right hands, the Slurpee Maker can be a great toy to use occasionally, but I'm left feeling that anyone who can actually operate the product successfully is unlikely to be satisfied with how much you get out of it relative to the time investment in using it.",toys games,health personal care
381,"Jarrow Coconut Oil Unrefined oil is not processed, bleached, deodorized and stripped so I will always pick that over the refined, but I must admit that I don't use coconut oil for cooking, I use it on my skin and hair! Although this oil has a very high smoking point, I am always worried about the true health benefits. Coconut oil may be associated with atherogenesis (disease affecting arterial blood vessels) so I choose to use for the topical benefits rather than ingesting it.I have learned from my boss who is form India, the secrets to her lovely shiny hair, and it's simply about warming up some coconut oil. I spoon it out if it's solid into a small glass bowl and microwaving for about 15 seconds then massaging my hair and scalp then tying a bun and letting it soak in for as long as I can ( anywhere between 15 minutes to hours or even overnight) then shampooing out with a clarifying or non moisturizing shampoo. Usually one shampoo is enough, sometimes if I have extra oil on the hair I shampoo again and then condition as usual.The sheen, bounce and manageability is incredible, I have never been as impressed with a product for the hair as with this simple treatment. The oil is inexpensive and lasts forever and the results are simply dazzling. For those with dry and fried hair, colored, tired or simply hair that needs a deep treatment this is heavenly. Even fine hair that has never been abused can benefit for it.I use this as often as I can, but once a week is sufficient, although the way the hair feels after is addictive and I can never wait to do it again.- Kasia S.",grocery gourmet food,beauty

Well, that's because they are--look at the ingredients. The first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup! As far as taste is concerned, these bars are tops, but the protein count is low compared to everything else on the market and the empty calories are through the roof.

Guess what, they aren't from perspiration... they are from the aluminum and other harmful metals and chemicals in traditional deodorants. This product makes the entire deodorant/antipirspirant industry obsolete and a health harming scam.The skin if very porous and absorbable, especially in the sensitive underarm areas and a daily dose of aluminum and chemicals will cause ill health eventually. Stop using that crap and use this natural salt stone... it contains all of the trace minerals that your body needs and the salt helps to keep you dry. If your body needs minerals it will abosorb them, if it doesn't, they will add protection from odor and staining. Need I go on???",beauty,health personal care

After using the soap my skin actually feel smoother and healthier than it did before. Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have. The scent is nice, but not overbearing. The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don't feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief. Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it. For how much better this soap feels I don't mind my annual hand soap budget going from $10 to $15 dollars.Overall 5 stars for a great product at a great price.

403,"Miracle Coat Dog Grooming Shear I bought these scissors to trim around the ears and eyes of my dogs. I would say for the price, the quality is just average, and the sharpness could have been better. I have a pair of the round tip scissors I had gotten at a local drug store for much less to use on people, and I would say the quality is just as good (if not better). These scissors are lightweight, but the opening for the fingers is a bit small, and they don't seem to have any bulk to them...thus feeling flimsy. I will need to sharpen them before I use them again.Regarding the case they came in. It's okay, but I know over time, the snap is going to break off as it doesn't feel like it's great quality either.Overall, they rate to me as just average. I really think you can do just as well buying these type of scissors at a local drug store or discount store (Target, K-Mart, WalMart), or even at a discount beauty supply store for lots less...perhaps saving $5 or more. That's just my opinion. Hope this helped you decide what to do.",pet supplies,health personal care
